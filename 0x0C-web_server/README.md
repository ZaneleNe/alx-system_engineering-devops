Web Server Basics Definition: A web server is a software application or hardware device that stores, processes, and delivers web content to clients over the Internet. It plays a fundamental role in enabling the accessibility of websites and web applications.

Key Components:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The foundation of communication on the World Wide Web. Facilitates the exchange of information between clients (web browsers) and servers.
Server Software: Examples include Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and others. Responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and delivering the appropriate response.
Document Root: The main directory on the server where web content (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) is stored. Clients access content by requesting specific files within this directory.
IP Address and Domain Name: Servers are identified on the Internet by their IP addresses. Domain names provide human-readable aliases for IP addresses.
Port: Servers listen on specific ports for incoming connections. Default HTTP port is 80; HTTPS uses port 443.
Protocols: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) encrypts data during transmission, enhancing security. SSL/TLS protocols are commonly used for secure communication. Server-Side Scripting and Databases:
Server-Side Scripting: Dynamic content generation using server-side languages (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby). Allows customization of content based on user requests.
Databases: Storage and retrieval of data to support dynamic web applications. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Security Considerations:
Firewalls and Security Software: Protects the server from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
Regular Software Updates: Ensures that the server software and operating system have the latest security patches.
Access Controls: Restricts access to sensitive files and directories. Uses authentication mechanisms to verify user identity. Scalability:
Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overload.
Caching: Stores frequently accessed content to reduce server load and improve response times. Monitoring and Logging:
Log Files: Record information about server activity, errors, and user interactions. Essential for troubleshooting and performance analysis.
Monitoring Tools: Keep track of server health, resource usage, and potential issues. Examples include Nagios, New Relic, and Prometheus.
